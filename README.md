## About <a name = "about"></a>

This repository is dedicated to my practice and notes as I learn **Scala** by following some **Coursera** and other courses. Here, I will store the code for the course projects as well as my learning notes.

## Repository Content <a name = "repository_content"></a>

1. **Learning Notes**  
   - I have created an **Excalidraw** file with my visual notes and summaries of the concepts learned throughout the course.
   - The notes file is located in the `notes/` folder.

2. **Course Projects**  
   - Throughout the course, I will complete various projects, which I will download and upload here.
   - The projects will be organized into separate folders within the repository.

## Learning Notes

As part of my learning process, I've made visual notes using Excalidraw. You can view an image of the notes below:
